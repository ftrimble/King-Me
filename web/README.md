# King Me

KingMe is a training platform for storing, analyzing, and sharing your riding
data. It will integrate with a corresponding Android application, and will
provide an immersive environment for all your training needs.

## Website Features

- Ride log
  A user needs to be able to keep track of their rides. This is the core
  function of a training platform.

- Ride organization
  Strava's main mode of user interaction is through the ride feed. This doesn't
  make a lot of sense to me, since previous rides are not a great nexus for
  social activity. While users should definitely be able to see past rides and
  comment on the awesome training regimen of another user, seeing every ride
  seems silly. The main unifying component should be rides that are happening in
  the future. As such, a planning component should be added that allows users to
  create rides and set a date and time when it will occur. This would also allow
  users to connect with nearby cyclists that they don't actually know in real
  life, which is a much more valuable utilization of the power of the internet
  than just seeing what the people who you probably ride with anyways are doing.

- Friend status
  While seeing all the rides that have happened is a bad user feed, it is very
  worthwhile to see how much other users are training. Instead, users should be
  able to switch to a feed of their favorite other users and see how they're
  doing. This might include how many miles they're doing per week, how many KOMs
  they're getting, and/or how often they schedule rides. Then, if the user is
  still interested, they would be able to get a per user expansion of rides.

- Ride segments
  Part of training is competing. By providing hotspots that users can compete
  for, it makes it significantly more interesting to ride. These should have
  leaderboards available that can be filtered based on your friend group or
  other attributes.

- Course database
  Users should be provided with a database of nearby courses. These should give
  users an idea of good rides to do. These may just be rides, or they may be
  specially generated and separate from rides.

- Ride creation
  Users should be able to map rides out on a map. Additionally, they should be
  able to send these courses directly to their phone so that they can follow
  the course and compete on the segments.

- Interaction
  Users should be able to have a friend group, cycling clubs, and should be able
  to create events, send messages, make comments, etc.

- Training summary
  Users should be able to have at-a-glance metrics for how well they have been
  training recently.
