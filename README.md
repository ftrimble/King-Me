# King Me


_A platform for exploring, training, and competing using GPS data
    for bicycling._

## Similar Services


- Strava

  Strava is an excellent website for competition; this may even be a valid
  endpoint for the data we collect, at least preliminarily. However, their app
  leaves much to be desired - it does not allow you to navigate along a course,
  track your progress against a segment, or any such information. Instead, it
  tracks only speed, distance, and time.

- Other websites

  There are various other websites which are similar to strava, but as far as
  I can tell, none realy compare.

- Garmin

  Garmin covers the opposite end of the spectrum; where strava has a superb web
  interface for consolidating your data and tracking your progress, Garmin
  lacks. However, it is the only dedicated cycling gps device available, and it
  is leaps and bounds ahead of any similar concept. Unfortunately, they exploit
  their monopoly here, and charge exorbitant prices for their devices. By
  providing the same functionality integrated into a phone, we can reach a
  much greater audience. Additionally, their hardware is riddled with bugs,
  which greatly detract from the experience.

## Components

- Android application

  This component will provide very good data collection and display during rides
  for the interested user

- Website

  This component will allow users to look at a history of their training, find
  and create new rides, connect with other cyclists, and plan new training
  activities. It will have very good connectivity to the device so that the user
  can plan activities on the website and have them immediately available on
  their device.
